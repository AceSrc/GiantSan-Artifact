v1.1 2003/08/18	
	(2003/08/17) PS1 - replaced calc_lon algorithm by a faster
	implementation. This results in speedups of up to factor 3.3 for
	certain large input files.
	(2003/08/17) PS1 - added --invert option.
	(2003/08/17) PS1 - improved error messages on wrong file format.
	(2003/08/17) PS1 - code cleanup to build under fussier compilers.
	Thanks to Nelson Beebe for submitting compiler logs for a large
	number of setups.
	(2003/08/17) PS1 - renamed curve.c:quad as quadform to avoid name
	clash on IBM AIX, Compaq/DEC ODF/1.
	(2003/08/17) PS1 - autoconf: let user override CFLAGS at configure
	time, and use -Wall and -O3 only for gcc compiler
	(2003/08/16) PS1 - added --blacklevel option to control
	image-to-bitmap conversion
	(2003/08/16) PS1 - added ability to read BMP files. Changed error
	reporting in case of empty files, or if there is junk at the end
	of a file in multipage mode.
	(2003/08/14) PS1 - as a convenience, now also read files in PGM
	and PPM format and convert to bitmap by simple threshold method.
	This is because many programs, including the Gimp and the *topnm
	tools, produce PNM output which must be further converted to PBM.
	(2003/08/14) PS1 - rearranged order of options in usage message.
	(2003/08/14) PS1 - implemented -d1 option for SVG backend. This
	outputs a jaggy bitmap with no smoothing.
	(2003/08/14) PS1 - autoconf: improved handling of
	--enable-compress
	(2003/08/14) PS1 - added SVG backend.
	(2003/08/14) PS1 - renamed old -s option as -S
	(2003/08/12) PS1 - added README.win
	(2003/08/12) PS1 - autoconf: fixed bug #787182: added non-standard
	compile time options to help message for ./configure script
	
v1.0 2003/08/10	
	(2003/08/10) PS1 - added file i/o code
	(2003/08/08) PS1 - optimized number of times the penalty3 function
	is called. Speedups of factor 2.7 were observed on large files.
	(2003/08/08) PS1 - added --opttolerance and --alphamax options.
	(2003/08/07) PS1 - autoconf: changed configure.in so that test for
	compress is omitted when the user overrides it - this prevents a
	wrong cached value to be read.
	(2003/08/07) PS1 - keep output flushed in postscript mode
	(2003/08/07) PS1 - fixed memory leak in multiple page mode
	(2003/08/06) PS1 - replaced --opticurve by --longcurve option;
	opticurve is now the default
	(2003/08/06) PS1 - added opticurve sensitivity to pgm backend
	(2003/08/06) PS1 - restricted opticurves to be bounded away from
	180 degrees
	(2003/08/06) PS1 - allow margins and papersize to determine width
	if it is not defined by other means in postscript mode
	(2003/08/06) PS1 - added ability to read multiple bitmaps in
	postscript mode
	(2003/08/05) PS1 - new --longcoding option
	(2003/08/05) PS1 - new optimized eps backend which works with
	opticurve.
	(2003/07/31) PS1 - replaced O(n^3) calc_lon algorithm by a new
	O(n^2) algorithm. Observed speedups of factor 80.
	(2003/07/27) PS1 - added --opticurve option and integrated
	opticurve code in curve.c
	(2003/06/04) PS1 - made bm_to_pathlist a lot more efficient by
	scanning and clearing only bounding box of mask in inner scan.
	(2002/11/17) PS1 - changed bm_to_pathlist prototype to use
	explicit return value.
	(2002/10/09) PS1 - autoconf: added automake/autoconf scripts in
	preparation for public distribution.
