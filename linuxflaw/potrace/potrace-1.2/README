	   POTRACE - transform bitmaps into vector graphics
			
				* * *
	   
DESCRIPTION

 Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming
 a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM,
 PGM, PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector
 file formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned
 data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.
 The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can
 then be rendered at any resolution.

 Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
 PostScript, SVG (scalable vector graphics), PGM (for easy
 antialiasing of pixel-based images), and XFig. An experimental
 Gimppath backend is also provided. Additional backends might be added
 in the future.

 A separate program, mkbitmap, is also provided. This program can act
 as a pre-processor for potrace, applying scaling and various filters
 to an image before converting it to a bitmap. This is useful for
 potracing greyscale and color images.

DEPENDENCIES

 Potrace relies on the zlib library for PostScript level 3
 compression. This library is pre-installed on most modern systems. 
 If not present, it can be obtained from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/.

 Potrace uses the external 'compress' program for PostScript level 2
 compression. If this program is not present, or if the
 --disable-compress option is given to ./configure, then potrace will
 be configured without support for PostScript level 2 compression (see
 also PATENT ISSUES below).

COMPILATION

 For generic compilation instructions, see the file INSTALL.  In
 addition, the following compile time options (options to ./configure)
 are supported:

 --enable-compress:   enable PostScript level 2 compression via the
	 	      external "compress" program
 --disable-compress:  disable PostScript level 2 compression
 --enable-metric:     use metric units (centimeters) as default
 --enable-a4:	      use a4 as the default papersize

INSTALLING

 If you are installing from sources, just do "make install" as root.
 If you are installing from a binary distribution, just copy the
 "potrace" and "mkbitmap" binaries to a place where the operating
 system expects them, such as /usr/local/bin. Also copy the files
 "potrace.1" and "mkbitmap.1" to a directory where the operating
 system looks for man pages, such as /usr/local/man/man1. For
 instructions on installing potrace under Windows, see the file
 README.win.

PATENT ISSUES

 Potrace uses PostScript level 2 compression by default.
 Unfortunately, the LZW algorithm which performs this compression is
 patented, and thus it cannot be implemented directly in potrace.  We
 circumvent this problem by using the external compress program to
 perform the actual compression, then transforming the output into the
 required format.  Note that the compress program is a separate piece
 of software and is not a part of potrace; it is the user's
 responsibility to ensure that his or her copy of compress is properly
 licensed.

 On systems where the compress program is not available, one should
 disable level 2 compression by specifying the -c or -3 options. It is
 also possible to configure potrace at compile time not to use
 compress; in this case, level 2 compression will not be available.
 Normally, the presence of the compress program is detected
 automatically at compile time.  It can be overridden by passing the
 --enable-compress or --disable-compress option to ./configure.
